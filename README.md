# TriCaster QuadSwitcher

This is a ~~rough~~ simple HTML/Javascript Page I built in a couple hours to play around with the control API in the Advanced Edition of NewTek TriCaster. The TriCaster is a video switcher that lets you mix cameras, videos, graphics and many other feeds into a video that can be recorded and streamed. This page allows you to switch 4 cameras by clicking on the preview of the one you want to take. Also included a red tally box around the currently selected source. Popup asks for IP or hostname of unit. Can by hard coded by setting the cTricaster variable

## Installation

Probably need to host it off a webserver rather than just doubleclicking it because it requires jQuery and starting that way throws a cross site scripting error.

## Tests

Example set up at: https://bennettwarner.github.io/tricasterquadswitch/control.html

## Contributors

If anyone wants to contribe please feel free. I probably won't do any further development on this.
